Two types of exports
    Default exports
    Named exports

super(); => when inheriting (extends keyword) from parent class, super method called inside child class constructor
            to call the parent constructor


REST OPERATOR => takes the arguments to an array
let test = (...args) => {
    return args.filter(item => item > 2);
}

COMPONENT => reusable building blocks In UI
Declarative Approach => when you update the code, react knows what has to be removed or added to the DOM
